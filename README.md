## Game of Life project for FreeCodeCamp challenge

### Features
The Game of Life is a classic board game based on the simple idea that neighbours prosper or die depending on proximity to each other and available natural resources during their life span. The computer simulation represents that as a series of grid blocks that expand into nearby area and rapidly expand and eventually die over time.
